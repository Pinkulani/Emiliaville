<p> 
  This Website is made for learning but also for the challange.
  I had this idea for a few months now. 
  I want to write many educational things here and just generally try things out.
  So I can learn as many things as possible.

  <h3>Donate Button</h3>

<h2 align="center"> Requirements </h2> <br>
<p>
  The <b> .htacess file </b>  is important for the Website to remove the .html ending for every adress.
  Nothing will work without this file!
  And accesing the sites locally is only possible by manually going through each one.
