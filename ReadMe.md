  This Website is made for learning but also for the challange.
  I want to write many educational things here and just generally try things out.
  So I can learn as many things as possible.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>
<p>
  I created a kind of (half-manual) Content Management System.
  By using the HTML Loader that I wrote you can load any content like an Article from Storage by adding a link to the configuration.
  And create a HTML File where that text should appear.
  When visiting any page it will first automatically load the layout of the website and then load the content of the page.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Requirements</h2> <br>
<p>
  The <b> .htaccess file </b>  is important for the Website to remove the .html ending for every adress.
