            <p> 
                This is the Inventory. 
                This is the place where many different documents will be stored.
                From all sorts of topics that I read or want to write about.

            <h2>Computer Science</h2>

                    This is not just Computer Science!
                </span>
                <br>
                I will also write about Electrical Engineering and Web Developement.
                All these subjects are very fun.
                And IT sounds like a boring term to talk about all these.

            <h2>Personal Care</h2>
            <p>
                Here I want to talk about body care and mental care.
                Although I might not be the most healthy I know a few things that I had to learn the hard way over time.

            <h2>Text</h2>
            <p>
                Here I will be talking about how to write Text documents. 
                Mostly I need to learn this for my studies to be formally correct.
                But it's good to know either way.
