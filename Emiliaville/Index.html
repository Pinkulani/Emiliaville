                This Website is completely custom made. 
                It contains various different things.
                Like a collection of documents.
                <br> <br>
                It is pretty much a gurantee that this Website will undergo many design changes.
                Maybe even a different structure.
                I want to try to find the best solution that works for me.
                This Website is not optimized for mobile use.
