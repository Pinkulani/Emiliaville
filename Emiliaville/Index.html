                <p>
                    My name is Emilia. 
                    I'm doing many things as a hobbyist.
                </p>

                    I'm more of a creative person than a logical but I'm still mostly doing things that require logic.
                    I've also become a runner and I'm on my way to do a 5K-Run in 20min.
                    Learning things has become a big part of my life.
                    And so has teaching too as I think the best way to understand anything is to be able to teach it to someone.
                    I'm planning on getting a Doctorate and have other unrealistic goals that <span class="highlight">I will never give up</span>.
                    But maybe they aren't so unrealistic after all...

                <h2>About this Website</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="important">This Website is not optimized for mobile use.</span>
                    As sad as that may be the main focus of this website is being used on Tablet-sized screens.
                    <br> <br>
                    I've always wanted to start a website and focus on a bigger Project.
                    In August 2023 I finally started this Website.
                    Everything here is custom made by me.
                    This means it won't really be good since I have basically no experience on running a Website.
                    But it's a pretty fun thing any way.
                    <br> <br>
                    I'm publishing my Notes here publically about various topics or interesting things. 
                    This is called <span class="highlight">working in public</span>.
                    I have trouble understanding logical topics like Math and if I take Notes I will try to explain them to myself as best as possible.
                    If I can understand it everyone else should be able to do it as well.
                    So I will give out all my Notes but with no warranty of correct information.
                    I will mostly be writing about general things.
                    All my documents have a added date and might be outdated.
                    If I am being informed about these issues then I can go ahead and fix them.
                    But I'm being very careful about how and what I write.
