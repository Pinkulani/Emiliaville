                This is a knowledge Library. 
                It is completely written by me. 
                I made this Website to share my knowledge or opinion on various topics.
                This is a personal learning experience for me and doubles as a place where I can lock up information I have worked on before.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many topics that are very complicated for me to understand.
                I might spend days to years on a certain thing.
                If I'm able to understand something then it should be understandable by everyone else aswell.
                For example understanding mathematical topics is a challenge for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is pretty much a gurantee that this Website will undergo many design changes.
                Maybe even a different structure.
                The first design of everything will be flawed.
                So will be the second, third, ... .
                As there are many different ways to tackle a problem.
                I want to try to find the best solution that works for me.
            </p>

               Documents might get outdated but everything I write has a added date.
               If there is an issue you can contact me and I will have it fixed. <br> <br>
